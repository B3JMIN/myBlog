### I finally restart to learn dynamic programming ###

Dynamic programming: mainly guessing + recursion + memorization

if we memory all the fibonacci we dont need to recount the other side of fibonacci tree
time = subproblems * time/subproblems

5 easy steps to DP:
1. define subproblems
2. guess
3. relate subproblem solutions
4. recurse & memorize or build DP table bottom-up
5. solve the original problem 

Topological order??? for fibonacci, we have to computer from small to n, reverse just not working
for the time: just time * subproblem


Text justification and blackJack

will do some leetcode for this
