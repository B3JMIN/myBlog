# This is my first Blog of quarantine

My spring term become online courses, but I am pretty sure I have to find a job in the Fall term. This blog gonna record all the things I gonna learn and build for the 6 months.

### Here are some plans I gonna do:

- [] raspberry Pi for web server(learn Linux as well)
- [] Loorent
    - It is a big project I want to do but I hate front end,
    so I always relay on that, but I think it's time for it

- [] Android app
    - I have a plan for using AI on phone, but I even not start learning yet

- [] AWS lambda
    - Learn along with my uncle


### Working right now as a front end co-op developer
