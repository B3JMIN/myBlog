### I finally got a new job ###
I went to opentext waterloo for the fall term but just for 3 months. I worked as an iOS developer in a startup for one month and then I start this one. 

Manager asked me whether want to do front end or backend. I kind hate CSS even through I think he wants me cause I have front end experience.

I choose backend and I start learning Java. Spring-boot and all the cloud things. so far so good.

I havent do any leetcode after that. I was lazy all the time. but for now, I probably start doing side project first, and after that I gonna leetcode during quarantine。


打算一起学一下250， 虽然有想要靠近别人的意味，但是还是决定学一下
